This is my submission for WWDC 2022.

This app is designed for everyone that are interested in learning football tactics. One of the main feature of the app is the user can create their own formation to make the ultimate tactics. 
After you create your own freeform formation, LearnTactics will go through a few of the most infamous formations in the modern football history such as the 4-3-3, 4-4-2, and many others.

The reason of why I’m building this app is because I wanted to share my passion with many football fans who maybe are interested to watch football beyond the player and club. It’s also an homage to my favourite game this year, Football Manager!
